# Frameworks for Value Development

## Introduction
To develop products that deliver measurable value, organizations need structured approaches that guide decision-making and execution. This section outlines key frameworks that support value-driven development.

## Key Frameworks

### 1. Lean Startup
- Focuses on rapid iteration based on validated learning.
- Encourages minimal viable product (MVP) development to test assumptions quickly.
- Reduces risk by incorporating continuous user feedback.

### 2. Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI)
- Developed by Clayton Christensen and Tony Ulwick.
- Centers around understanding customer jobs-to-be-done (JTBD).
- Uses quantitative research to identify opportunities for innovation.

### 3. Design Thinking
- Human-centered approach emphasizing empathy, ideation, and prototyping.
- Helps teams explore problems deeply before jumping to solutions.
- Encourages iterative testing and user involvement.

### 4. Agile Product Development
- Framework focused on adaptive planning and iterative progress.
- Encourages cross-functional collaboration and fast feedback loops.
- Popular methodologies: Scrum, Kanban, SAFe.

### 5. Value Stream Mapping
- Identifies bottlenecks and inefficiencies in product development processes.
- Helps visualize end-to-end workflows to optimize for value delivery.

## Choosing the Right Framework
Selecting the appropriate framework depends on:
- **Market Uncertainty**: Lean Startup and Design Thinking work well in high uncertainty.
- **Customer Needs**: ODI is useful when customer expectations are unclear.
- **Process Efficiency**: Value Stream Mapping optimizes existing workflows.
- **Development Approach**: Agile works best for continuous delivery environments.
